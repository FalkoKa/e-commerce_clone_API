## README

This is the backend server for my e-commerce project. The server is an REST-API, based on the following technologies:

- NodeJS with ExpressJS
- PostgreSQL for the databse
- bcrypt for encypting passwords of users
- JWT (JSON Web Token) for user and admin authentification (stored in local storage)
- JOI for server-side data validation
